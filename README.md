# Real-time-image-to-sketch-Animation
A Python-based computer vision project 🐍 that converts images 🖼️ into real-time pencil sketch animations ✏️🎨. The project uses OpenCV and NumPy to detect edges 🖌️, generate contours 🔲, and animate strokes in a natural top-to-bottom order ⬇️ with realistic pencil shading ✏️💡.
